# v3.1.0 - Critical Fix: Skill Not Triggering

**Date**: 2025-10-23
**Type**: Patch Release
**Status**: Ready for Testing

## Problem Identified

User reported: "한번 프롬프팅을 했을때 firebase cli, tools를 안써서 자동배포가 안되는데"
(When prompted once, Firebase CLI/tools aren't used so auto-deployment doesn't work)

### Real User Log Evidence

From `/Users/conanssam-m4/claude-skill-test1023-3/todo-firebase-app/...`:

**Line 17**: User request:
```
> todo list앱을 만들어주세요 . firebase skill을 사용하고, 백엔드 ,db, 배포를 전부처리해주세요
```

**Line 19-88**: Claude's behavior:
- ❌ Created React project manually (not using skill)
- ❌ Installed Firebase SDK
- ❌ **Wrote `src/firebase.js` with placeholder values**:
  ```javascript
  apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
  authDomain: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID.firebaseapp.com",
  ```
- ❌ Created `firebase.json`, `firestore.rules` manually
- ❌ **Did NOT run any Firebase CLI commands**

**Line 904**: User frustrated response:
```
> 아니야 니가 firebase cli로 다 처리가능해 tools를 활용하라고
```
(No, you can handle everything with Firebase CLI, use the tools)

**Line 906-1040**: Only THEN did Claude use Firebase CLI:
- ✅ Ran `npx firebase projects:list`
- ✅ Found existing project "todo-app-251023"
- ✅ Ran `npx firebase apps:sdkconfig` to get real config
- ✅ Deployed successfully

## Root Cause Analysis

### Why Skill Didn't Trigger

**v3.0.0 SKILL.md opening** (problematic):
```markdown
# React Firebase Deployment

When a user asks you to create a React app with Firebase backend, follow this workflow...
```

**Problems**:
1. **Too generic**: "When a user asks..." is passive
2. **No explicit trigger keywords**: Claude didn't recognize "firebase skill을 사용하고"
3. **No DO/DON'T checklist**: Claude fell back to default behavior (create files manually)
4. **Buried in description**: Important info not at the top

### Why User Had to Ask Twice

1st prompt → Claude ignored skill → Created files manually
2nd prompt → User explicitly said "firebase cli로 다 처리가능해" → Claude complied

## The Fix (v3.1.0)

### 1. Added Explicit Trigger Conditions (Lines 8-15)

**New opening**:
```markdown
**CRITICAL**: When a user asks you to:
- "Create a React app with Firebase backend"
- "Make a todo app with Firebase"
- "Build a [X] app and deploy it with Firebase"
- "Use Firebase skill to build..."
- Mentions "Firebase" + "backend" + "deploy"

**YOU MUST immediately follow this skill workflow** - do NOT create files manually.
```

**Why this works**:
- **Bold "CRITICAL"** grabs attention
- **Bullet list of trigger phrases** matches user language
- **Explicit "YOU MUST"** is imperative, not passive
- **"do NOT create files manually"** prevents fallback behavior

### 2. Added DO/DON'T Checklist (Lines 29-39)

```markdown
**DO NOT**:
- ❌ Create package.json manually
- ❌ Write placeholder values like "YOUR_API_KEY"
- ❌ Create firebase.json without running CLI commands
- ❌ Skip Firebase CLI commands and just make files

**DO**:
- ✅ Run `npx firebase projects:create` to create real project
- ✅ Run `npx firebase apps:sdkconfig` to get real API keys
- ✅ Run `npx firebase deploy` to deploy
- ✅ Provide live URL at the end
```

**Why this works**:
- **Directly addresses the problem**: "DO NOT write placeholder values"
- **Visual markers (❌/✅)** make it scannable
- **Concrete actions**: Specific commands to run

### 3. Clarified New vs Existing Project Logic (Step 1)

**Before**:
```markdown
### Step 1: Get Project Details

Ask the user for:
- Project name (lowercase, no spaces, e.g., "todo-app")
```

**After**:
```markdown
### Step 1: Decide on Firebase Project

**IMPORTANT**: Check if user wants to use existing Firebase project or create new one.

**Default behavior**: Create a NEW Firebase project (don't ask user, just do it).

**Ask user ONLY if**:
- You detect they already have a Firebase project in current directory (`.firebaserc` exists)
- They explicitly mention "use my existing project"
```

**Why this works**:
- **Default to NEW**: Prevents searching for existing projects unnecessarily
- **Clear decision tree**: When to use existing vs create new
- **Prevents confusion**: User's log showed Claude found existing project when they wanted new one

### 4. Strengthened Step 5 (Create Firebase Project)

**Added**:
```markdown
### Step 5: Create Firebase Project

**ONLY IF creating NEW project** (Step 1 determined this).

**Skip this step if using existing project.**
```

**Why this works**:
- **Conditional execution**: Clear when to run vs skip
- **References Step 1**: Shows workflow connection

## Expected Behavior Change

### Before (v3.0.0)

```
User: "todo list앱을 만들어주세요 . firebase skill을 사용하고, 백엔드 ,db, 배포를 전부처리해주세요"

Claude's thought process:
- Sees "todo list앱" → Creates React app
- Sees "firebase" → Installs Firebase SDK
- Doesn't recognize skill trigger
- Falls back to default: Create files manually
- Writes placeholder values in config

Result: No Firebase backend, user has to ask again
```

### After (v3.1.0)

```
User: "todo list앱을 만들어주세요 . firebase skill을 사용하고, 백엔드 ,db, 배포를 전부처리해주세요"

Claude's thought process:
- Reads SKILL.md first
- Sees "**CRITICAL**: When a user asks..."
- Matches trigger: "firebase skill을 사용하고"
- Sees "YOU MUST immediately follow this skill workflow"
- Sees "DO NOT: Write placeholder values"
- Follows Steps 1-21

Result: Live URL with working Firebase backend on first try
```

## Testing Plan

### Test Case 1: Korean Trigger Phrase

**Prompt**:
```
todo list앱을 만들어주세요. firebase skill을 사용하고, 백엔드, db, 배포를 전부처리해주세요
```

**Expected**:
- ✅ Claude recognizes "firebase skill을 사용하고" as trigger
- ✅ Claude runs `npm create vite`
- ✅ Claude runs `npx firebase projects:create todo-app-<timestamp>`
- ✅ Claude runs `npx firebase apps:sdkconfig`
- ✅ Claude writes real API keys to `src/firebase/config.js`
- ✅ Claude deploys to Firebase Hosting
- ✅ Claude provides live URL

### Test Case 2: English Trigger Phrase

**Prompt**:
```
Create a todo app with Firebase backend and deploy it
```

**Expected**:
- ✅ Claude recognizes "Firebase backend" + "deploy" as trigger
- ✅ Same workflow as Test Case 1

### Test Case 3: Implicit Trigger

**Prompt**:
```
I need a React app with database and hosting
```

**Expected**:
- ❓ May not trigger (doesn't mention "Firebase")
- Claude should ask: "Would you like me to use Firebase for backend and hosting?"

### Test Case 4: Existing Project

**Setup**: Create `.firebaserc` with existing project ID

**Prompt**:
```
Add todo functionality to this Firebase project
```

**Expected**:
- ✅ Claude detects `.firebaserc`
- ✅ Claude uses existing project
- ✅ Claude skips Step 5 (create new project)
- ✅ Claude proceeds with implementation

## Success Criteria

v3.1.0 is successful if:

1. **Single prompt execution**: User gets deployed app from ONE prompt (not two)
2. **No placeholder values**: `src/firebase/config.js` has real API keys
3. **Firebase CLI used**: Claude runs `npx firebase` commands
4. **Live URL provided**: User gets working deployment link
5. **Correct trigger detection**: Works for both Korean and English phrases

v3.1.0 fails if:

1. User has to prompt twice
2. Claude writes "YOUR_API_KEY" placeholders
3. Claude creates files manually instead of using CLI
4. No deployment URL provided

## Rollback Plan

If v3.1.0 fails testing:
1. Revert to v3.0.0
2. Consider even stronger trigger format:
   ```markdown
   # WHEN TO USE THIS SKILL

   Use this skill IMMEDIATELY when user request contains ANY of these:
   - Words: "Firebase" + ("backend" OR "deploy" OR "database")
   - Phrases: "firebase skill", "use Firebase", "with Firebase"
   ```

## Next Version Ideas (v3.2.0)

If v3.1.0 succeeds, consider:
- Add authentication setup automation
- Add TypeScript template option
- Add Next.js variant support
- Add environment variable validation

---

**Version**: 3.1.0
**Priority**: Critical
**Status**: Ready for Testing
**Previous Version**: 3.0.0 (skill triggered only on 2nd prompt)
