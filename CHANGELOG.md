# Changelog

All notable changes to the React Firebase Deployment Skill.

## [2.1.0] - 2025-10-23

### ðŸš€ Major Changes - Command Execution

**BREAKING**: Transformed from documentation skill to execution skill.

#### Changed
- **SKILL.md completely rewritten** to execute commands automatically
- Changed all instructions from "Run this command" to "Execute: <command>"
- Added automatic command execution following pptx skill pattern
- Added output parsing and validation after each step

#### Added
- **Firebase Tools auto-installation**
  - Checks for `npx firebase --version`
  - Auto-installs `firebase-tools@latest` if missing or < v14.0.0
  - Auto-triggers `firebase login` if not authenticated

- **Command execution with validation**
  - Execute: `npm create vite@latest <project-name>`
  - Execute: `npx firebase projects:create <project-id>`
  - Execute: `npx firebase apps:create WEB <app-name>`
  - Execute: `npx firebase apps:sdkconfig WEB <app-id>`
  - Execute: `npx firebase deploy --only firestore`
  - Execute: `npm run build`
  - Execute: `npx firebase deploy --only hosting`

- **Output parsing instructions**
  - Parse project ID from creation output
  - Extract app ID from registration output
  - Parse SDK config JSON for all Firebase values
  - Extract deployment URL from hosting output

- **Validation steps after each command**
  - Check `package.json` exists after npm install
  - Verify `.env` file populated with actual values
  - Confirm `dist/` directory created after build
  - Parse deployment success messages

- **Automatic .env file generation**
  - Uses parsed values from `firebase apps:sdkconfig`
  - Creates `.env` with actual Firebase config
  - Creates `.env.example` with placeholders

#### Fixed
- **Issue**: Skill was not executing commands, only showing documentation
- **Issue**: Firebase CLI was never installed automatically
- **Issue**: User had to manually run all Firebase commands
- **Issue**: No validation that commands succeeded

#### Technical Details

**Before (Documentation format)**:
```markdown
1. **Create Firebase project**
   ```bash
   npx firebase projects:create [name]
   ```
```

**After (Execution format)**:
```markdown
1. **Create Firebase project**

   Execute: `npx firebase projects:create <project-id>`

   **Validation**: Parse output for "Firebase project <project-id> is ready!"

   **Save** the project ID from output for all subsequent commands.
```

#### Impact
- âœ… Claude now **executes** Firebase CLI commands instead of showing them
- âœ… Claude **parses** command output to extract IDs and config values
- âœ… Claude **validates** each step before proceeding
- âœ… Claude **creates files** with actual values (not placeholders)
- âœ… Complete automation from empty directory to deployed app
